Here we have modified the given lane-switching obstacle game by adding three new basic-level modifications like:

1. Countdown Before Game Starts

Before the actual game begins, a 3-second countdown (3…2…1…) is shown on the screen.

This gives the player time to get ready before the obstacles start falling.

This improves the user experience and makes the game look more polished.

2. Score System

A score counter is added at the top.

Every time the obstacle reaches the bottom and a new obstacle appears, the score increases by +1.

This helps the player track progress and improves gameplay motivation.

3. Difficulty Level (Dynamic Speed Increase)

After each score increase, the falling speed becomes slightly faster.

The variable speed decreases by 5 milliseconds each time (until it reaches a minimum).

This makes the game progressively harder, improving the challenge.

4. Restart or Exit Option

After the player hits the obstacle, the game shows a menu with two choices:

1. Restart – starts the game again from the beginning.

2. Exit – safely closes the game.

This makes the game more interactive and gives players control.
