------------ ASSIGNMENT 3 ----------------
CAR RACING MINI GAME

In this game, you control a small car that must avoid oncoming enemy cars.
Just like the previous mini-games, this one is also made using loops, simple drawing, and keyboard controls.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE GAME :-

-->This is a simple console-based car-racing game where your goal is to avoid crashing into enemy cars.

-->Use the LEFT (←) and RIGHT (→) arrow keys to move your car between three lanes.

-->Enemy cars spawn randomly from the top and move downward every step.

-->Your job is to stay away from enemy cars to avoid collisions.

-->Every time you dodge an enemy car successfully, your score increases.

-->The game starts slow but keeps increasing speed as you survive longer.

-->If your car collides with an enemy car, the game stops and shows a GAME OVER message with your final score.

-->The game uses loops, keyboard input, and simple ASCII art to give a racing-game feel.
